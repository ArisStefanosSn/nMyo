# nMyo

We have developed the nMyo R shiny applet and associated R package to visualise the single-cell RNAseq expression profiles of 2031 high-quality mouse cardiac non-myocytes.

The repository can be cloned as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArisStefanosSn/nMyo
```

The package can be installed in R as:

```r
install.packages("nMyo_1)
```
